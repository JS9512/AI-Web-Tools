# AI Web Tools

## Overview

AI Tools is a simple mobile application inspired by https://github.com/steven-kamanga/Brain and written in Flutter, it provides shortcuts to popular AI websites in a comfortable manner.

Keep in mind it's still a WIP and it's slowly being developed in my free time.

It may have some bugs in recent Android versions, so bear with me.
